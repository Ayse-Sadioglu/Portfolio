Personal website built with React.js.
I am aware that places of images are not fine but to fix that i need to learn css.. (I am working on it)

UPDATE: You can run it with "npm start", I am planning to add carousel view to Experience.js but now it is missing because i am still working on the other parts.
UPDATE2: Currently working on deployment
